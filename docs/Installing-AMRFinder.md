# Installation

AMRFinderPlus requires HMMER, BLAST+, Linux, and perl. We provide a [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) package, Linux binaries, and the source code is available to compile AMRFinderPlus yourself though we haven't extensively tested compiling AMRFinderPlus on other systems and aren't supporting non-Linux systems at this time.

# How to install

## Bioconda

We provide instructions for three methods of installation. The simplest, and recommended method is to [[install AMRFinderPlus|Install with bioconda]] and all of the prerequisites with bioconda. See [[Install with bioconda]].

## Other methods
