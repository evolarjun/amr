`amrfinder_update` will download the latest version of the AMRFinderPlus database and by default make a directory format under the amrfinder directory with a directory for the database and a link from 'latest' to that directory.

You should end up with a directory structure something like the following:

    amr |
        |-data
            |-latest -> 2018-11-07.1
            |-2018-11-07.1
            |-2018-09-14.1
